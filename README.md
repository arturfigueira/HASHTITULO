# HASHTITULO
HASHTITULO is a CA Fast Data Masker custom function, made to enable CA FDM to consistently mask Brazilian Voter Registration Number (in Portuguese TÃ­tulo de Eleitor).

## Main Features

* The function will hash Brazilian Titulo.
* The function can change the Federative Unit (UF) or keep the original after the masking.
* The function ensures the same format and consistent masks for the same original value, but does not ensure uniqueness.
* The mask algorithm is based on CA Fast Data Masker *FORMATHASH*.
* It will maintain nulls and empty strings.

## Getting Started

### Build Prerequisites

These instructions for how to get and compile the source code. The project was created with **Gradle** to build and handle dependencies. All required libs (*minus one, see below*) are handled automatically by Gradle. This project works with **Java 1.8+**.

```
gradle init --type java-library
```

**CA FastDataMasker lib** is also required. It's presented as part of the Fast Data Masker application, which can only by used by those whom has a valid CA FDM license. The lib is not presented at this repository and should be manually added to *libs* folder, after you have push the code into your workstation.

```
Project Root
  --libs
    --FastDataMasker.jar
```

### Installing

A step by step, with examples, that tell you how to get the built function working on a CA Fast Data Masker installation.

First of all, custom functions support were added at **CA Fast Data Masker version 4.3**. So, if you have a version prior to this, stop now and update it to the last release, or this will not work at all.

Go to the FDM install folder and create a folder called `custom`.
```
Usually it's installed at C:\Program Files\Grid-Tools\FastDataMasker
```

Download a `jar` from one of the available project's [Releases](https://github.com/arturfigueira/HASHTITULO/releases) page. Add this `jar` to the `custom` folder from the previous step.

Modify the provided *custom_config.xml* and add the xml below inside the `<functions>` tag.

```xml
<function>
  <name>HASHTITULO</name>
  <description>HASHTITULO - Consistently mask a given Brazilian Voter Registration Number, 
  retaining the original format of the number</description>
  <parm1>UF - Change the original UF to a fixed one (Use the abbreviation of the Federative Unit. ex: RJ, SP, MG...). If null, the hashed value will maintain its original UF</parm1>
  <parm2></parm2>
  <parm3></parm3>
  <parm4></parm4>
  <char>true</char>
  <number>true</number>
  <date>false</date>
  <char_date>false</char_date>
  <custom>true</custom>
  <class_name>com.ca.datamasker.custom.HashTitulo</class_name>
</function>
```

The function will be available for **Number** and **Character** data types, It usually will be placed at the end of available functions with the name `HASHTITULO`.


### Examples

Below you can find some examples, with the input Titulo and how the function will mask it:

| Titulo        |   UF   | Masked Titulo | Obs                                                      |
| --------------|:------:|---------------| ---------------------------------------------------------|
| 84608999256   | *Null* | 21512222079   | Masked value with check digi, without changing UF        |
| 84608999256   |  *RJ*  | 21512222079   | Masked value with check digit, changing its original UF  |
| *Null*        |        | *Null*        | Masking function will maintain Null values               |
| `Empty`       |        | `Empty`       | Masking function will maintain Empty values              |
